# LAN & Network Administration 🌐💻

## Overview 📝
This project demonstrates hands-on experience designing and implementing a corporate LAN using Cisco Packet Tracer and configuring IP addresses, Subnet mask, Default gateway and DNS Server in PCs. I created VLANs for different departments, set up DHCP and DNS services, and tested connectivity across devices.

It covers:
- 🏗️ VLAN design and configuration in Cisco Packet Tracer  
- 💻 Assigning static and DHCP IP addresses in Windows  
- 📡 DHCP and DNS configuration  
- 🛠️ Network testing and troubleshooting

## Skills Demonstrated 🎯
- 🖧 VLAN segmentation for Sales, IT, and Server departments  
- ⚙️ Configuring DHCP and DNS on PCs 
- 🧰 Using network troubleshooting tools (`ping`)  
- 🔍 Verifying connectivity within VLANs and between VLANs  
- 🌐 Visualizing network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer

## What I Did 🚀
1. Designed VLANs in Cisco Packet Tracer and assigned switch ports to each VLAN.  
2. Assigned static IPs to servers and configured DHCP for client PCs.    
3. Tested connectivity within VLANs, between VLANs, and to simulated Internet.  
4. Created a VLAN diagram with labeled IP addresses and device roles.
